# Super DIPPID Boy

Small gesture controlled 2D side-scroller that was developed as the final project of the 'Interaction Techniques and 
Technologies' (ITT) course in the summer semester 2021 at the University of Regensburg. Uses a Dippid Device (either a M5Stack or a smartphone with the Dippid-Android-App) to move the player character as well as the $P recognizer to detect gestures drawn with the mouse.
